This container derives from
[vcatechnology/centos-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/centos-ci) so that the
image has the latest [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) packages. It then
installs the some packages for building VCA5.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/centos-vca5](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/centos-vca5/)
